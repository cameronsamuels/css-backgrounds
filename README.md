### CSS Background Designs

Pure CSS background designs such as checkerboard and rainbow backgrounds.

#### Configuration

Keep in mind that these backgrounds do not have vendor-specific prefixes,
so they may need to be added to render correctly.

The `body` will need to have the following styles to display the background over the entire page.

```css
body {
  margin: 0;
  width: 100vw;
  height: 100vh;
}
```
